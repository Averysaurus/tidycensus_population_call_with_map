- You need a `Census API key` to access Census Bureau API

<https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html>
  
  -   Key will be sent to your email fairly quickly

Info for all public facing Census API: <https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets.html>*
  
Uncomment and run chunk below to store Census key locally.
```{r}
# census_api_key("YOuR CENSUS API KEY HERE",
#              install = TRUE) 
#  store locally
# census_api_key(key = my_census_api_key)
```

- Load variables available from Census Bureau API 

- Info explaining each value in the `dataset` argument. 
<https://api.census.gov/data.html> 
  
```{r}
acs_2019_vars <- load_variables(2019,   # year 
                 dataset = 'acs1',      # specify `acs1` data
                  cache = T) %>%        # save call locally 
  # tab out results as window
  View()
```


-  There's lots of variables here! Below we slice out relevant population counts for sex, age, and race.  

```{r}

acs2019_slice <- load_variables(2019, # relevant variable names. 
                  dataset = 'acs1', 
                  cache = T) %>%
                 slice(1:328) #subset top 328 rows 
```

* Create Object with those `328` variables, spaced in a friendly way to add
to a `get_acs()` call to the API. 

```{r}
acs_vars <- 
  # add white-space on both sides. 
  str_pad(acs2019_slice$name, 1,
          side = 'both', 
          pad = ' ') 
head(acs_vars)
```

With a little clever text-editing (hold *Ctrl* key to select tabular-ly and dragging around) we can create a concatenated list of all variables.

```{r}

# All "population" variables by sex and race? 2019 ACS

Next we call the Census Bureau API, asking to download `all_those_vars` for each Census tract in San Francisco. Setting the `geometry` argument as TRUE includes spatial data associated to each census tract. We can use the spatial data for sanity testing, evaluation of the API call. 

```{r, message = FALSE}

sfpop2019_acs <- get_acs(
  geography = 'tract',          # tract level data
  variables = all_those_vars,   # 328 variables from above list. 
  state = 'CA',
  county = 'San Francisco', 
  geometry = T                  # add geometry
)

```

 - Join with variables loaded, clean up excess string detritus. 

```{r}

# join with `load_variable` return to label variables. 
sfpop2019_clean <- left_join(sfpop2019_acs,         
  acs2019_slice, 
  by = c('variable' = 'name')) %>% 
  select(-variable) %>%          # remove "variable" variable
  janitor::clean_names() %>%     # snake_case all column names. 
  
  # manipulate strings in concept and label column for legibility sake. 
  mutate(
         concept = str_to_lower(concept),
         label = str_remove_all(label, 'Estimate!!'), 
         label = str_replace_all(label, '!!', ' '), 
         label = str_replace_all(label, ':', ''),
         label = str_to_lower(label),
         # extract census tract code from verbose column.
         name = str_extract_all(name, '(\\d+.\\d+)'),
         name = as.character(name)) %>% 
  # rename column.
  rename(census_tract = name)

```

- Visualize summary object, symettrical relationship between `concept` and `label` variables.

```{r}

sfpop2019_clean %>% 
  # drop un-weildy spatial information 
  st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  # group by concept column and count labels per concept. 
  group_by(concept) %>% 
  summarise(n_labels_per_tract = n()) %>% 
  
  # create bar chart of summary object
  mutate(concept = fct_reorder(concept, n_labels_per_tract)) %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=concept, y=n_labels_per_tract)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", fill="sea green", 
             alpha=.6, width = .5) +
    coord_flip() +
    ylab("Labels * Census Tracts for Each Concept") +
    xlab('') +
  theme_bw() 

```



* Sanity Check: mapping subset variables.

- this function should take a minute to resolve due to all the 'sticky' spatial stuff in the `geometry` column. It's unwieldy due to its size, large n of rows. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# use leaflet wrapper for interactive map object. 
mapview(sfpop2019_clean, zcol="census_tract", 
        legend = F)

```

Farallon Islands has a census tract, it's out in the Pacific Ocean. Hover over it to find its designation and remove from API call results.

```{r}

# filter where census tract is not in Pacific Ocean.
sf2019pop_last <- sfpop2019_clean %>% 
  filter(census_tract != 9804.01)


```

Evaluate variable returns with chloropleth map. 

```{r}

# test filter where total male 25-29
sf2019acs_test <- sf2019pop_last %>%
          # alter string based on 'concept' to evaluate
  filter(concept == "sex by age" &
           # alter string based on 'label' to evaluate
           str_detect(label, "total male 25 to 29 years")) %>% 
  # restructure estimate from character to numeric structure.
  mutate(estimate = as.numeric(estimate)) 

# map. hover over shape for estimate of tract population.
mapview(sf2019acs_test, zcol = 'estimate')


```

#### Notes: 

- When tabbing out dataframes with the `View()` function, there's a text-based filter tool at the top of the window you can type into and look for labels and concepts of interest. 

- Interactive maps are HTML objects and can be finnicky in the markdown window, try copy/pasting code into the R console window and running there to explore in R-studio viewer. 

- You can click on the census tract shapes in the map to look at all the data attributes associated with that shape. 

- You may also swap 'moe' with 'estimate' in the `zcol` argument to explore margin of error distributions.
